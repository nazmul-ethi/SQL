### What is SQL?

Structured Query Language, or SQL, is the language that helps manage databases. It helps in creating data, operating on it, and retrieving it. It is also the standard language used in the Relational Database Systems. Various Relational Database Systems like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MS Access, Postgres, Infomix, SQL Server, etc., have SQL as their base language.

### SQL VS NoSQL
| Comparison criteria | SQL | NoSQL |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
|Type of database | Relational | Non-relational|
|How is data stored? | Structured data in tables | Unstructured data in JSON files|
|Suitability for OLTP systems | Excellent | Average|
|Database compliance | ACID properties | CAP Theorem|

### SQL Process

When you run an SQL command against any RDBMS, the system figures out the best way to carry out your request, and the SQL engine figures out how to interpret it.

This procedure has a number of different components. Query Dispatcher, Optimization Engines, Classic Query Engine, and SQL Query Engine are some of these elements. Non-SQL queries are handled by the classic query engine, but logical files are not handled by the SQL query engine.
